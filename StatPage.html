                    <p>When reviewing the assessment points, the dark line notes the sum of points possible for each assessment. While the teal bars mark the sum of points gotten correct by the test takers.<br>
                    As you can see, majority of assessments received almost 50% of their total points. One assessment, Accounting, received almost all 100% of their points possible while Early Childhood Education received the least of their total points possible.</p><br>
                    <p>When reviewing the average points based on the grade received, we can see that those that did not pass received roughly a 52 which is about 18 below the passing grade of a 70.</p><br>
                    <p>In the next section, we will be able to recognize how many were tested in each assessment. <a href="StatPersonnelPage.html">Click here to continue.</a></p>
